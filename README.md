# clj-concordion

Add support for Clojure and `clojure.test` to  [Concordion](https://concordion.org/),
a Specification By Example tool.

With Concordion, you can write high-level specification of features in Markdown
and document them with examples. Hidden instrumentation (in the form of magic links)
binds the examples to functions in your Fixture classes making it possible to verify
them against the code. When you run your test runner, Concordion does generate 
HTML files incorporating results of the passed or failed examples/tests.

## Usage

Docs: [![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/clj-concordion/clj-concordion)](https://cljdoc.org/d/clj-concordion/clj-concordion/CURRENT)

### Preparation

Add a dependency on this project (copy the [latest dependency specification for Lein/Boot/deps.edn/Gradle/Maven from Clojars](https://clojars.org/clj-concordion)):

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/clj-concordion.svg)](https://clojars.org/clj-concordion)

(Depending on your build tool, you might also need to add an explicit dependency on `org.concordion/concordion`, [see our project.clj](https://github.com/holyjak/clj-concordion/blob/master/project.clj).)

### Coding

Given the Concordion specification `<class path>/math/Addition.md` containing:

```markdown
Adding [1](- "#n1") and [3](- "#n2") yields [4](- "?=add(#n1, #n2)").
```

you need to implement the function in a test namespace of a matching name (plus `-test`) and define the fixture for it:

```clojure
(ns math-test
  (:require
      [clojure.test :refer :all]
      [clj-concordion.core :as cc]))

; The arguments are always Strings
(defn add [n1 n2]
  (int (+ (Integer/parseInt n1) (Integer/parseInt n2))))

;; Create the fixture class and clojure.test test.
;; Notice that the name of the ns and fixture corresponds to the path to the specification
;; .md (excluding the "-test" suffix of the ns)
(cc/deffixture Addition)

;; Ensure Concordion is reset between each run (when running repeatedly via REPL)
(use-fixtures :once cc/cljtest-reset-concordion)
```

And run it:

```bash
$ lein with-profile auto test
lein test math-test

file:///var/folders/kg/r_8ytg7x521cvlmz_47t2rgc0000gn/T/concordion/math/Addition.html
Successes: 1, Failures: 0

Ran 1 tests containing 0 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

#### Deviation from Concordion

* See "Valid expressions in specification files" below
* The option `declaresFullOGNL` is not supported because we have our own evaluator.

##### Valid expressions in specification files

We use our own expression evaluator instead of Concordion's OGNL one, which has
some consequences, both positive and negative.

The expressions are a subset & superset of EDN and thus:

* Constants are supported. Ex.: `[ ](- "myFn(#var1, 'literal string', 123)")`  
* Keywords are allowed: `"doSomething(:action 'fire!')"`
* Commas are optional
* Spaces between elements may be _necessary_ (since `=` is a valid part of name in Clojure but in
  an expression we most likely want to break around it)
* Special handling of `'` and `#`: all `'` are replaced with `"` and all `#` are removed.
  This can conflict with test values that contain them - report an issue if it happens. 
  
See the [Expression specification](clj-concordion/expressions/Expressions.md) for details.

#### Options

Notice that `deffixture` takes a second, optional parameter, a map of options - [see the `:cc/opts` Clojure spec for valid keys and values](/holyjak/clj-concordion/blob/master/src/clj_concordion/specs.clj) and 
Concordion [Fixture classes docs](https://concordion.org/coding/java/markdown/#fixture-classes) (-> 
[FixtureDeclarations.java](https://github.com/concordion/concordion/blob/2.2.0/src/main/java/org/concordion/api/FixtureDeclarations.java),
 [ConcordionOptions.java](https://github.com/concordion/concordion/blob/2.2.0/src/main/java/org/concordion/api/option/ConcordionOptions.java),
 [ConcordionOptions spec](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/annotation/ConcordionOptions.html)) and below for their meaning.
 There is also an extensive [example in the `Addition deffixture`](https://github.com/holyjak/clj-concordion/blob/master/test/math/algebra_test.clj)
 
The options map replaces Concordion annotations on test classes (e.g. using `:concordion/impl-status :unimplemented` instead of `@Unimplemented`,
an individual `:concordion.option/<option-name>` instead of `@ConcordionOptions(<optionName>=..)`, `@FailFast(onExceptionType={DatabaseUnavailableException.class})` -> 
`:concordion/fail-fast-exceptions [Throwable]`) etc.), annotations on test methods such as [Before and After Hooks][before-after-hooks], and exposes additional configuration (see below).

[before-after-hooks]: https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/annotation/BeforeAndAfterMethodHooks.html


##### Unsupported Concordion options

* There is yet no support for [adding resources ~ `@ConcordionResources`](https://concordion.org/coding/java/markdown/#adding-resources) because I haven't figured out how to enable doing it for all / subset of fixtures instead of just a single fixture. Suggestions welcome!
* ` @FullOGNL` because we use our own expression implementation instead of OGNL (and it provides Â± the same power, if not more)
* [Adding Extensions with `@org.concordion.api.extension.Extensions`](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/common/extension/ExtensionConfiguration.html) - you can do this instead by setting the system property `concordion.extensions`

##### clj-concordion specific options

* `:cc/no-asserts?` - if `true` do not log a warning when the specification has no asserts (i.e. `?=...`, `c:assertTrue=...` etc). 
* `:cc/no-trim?` - if `true` do not `trim` variable values (which we do because Concordion includes an extraneous whitespace in table-initialized variables)
* `:cc/(before|after)-*` - see below

##### Setup & tear-down functions

The `opts` argument to `deffixture` can also contain [setup/tear-down functions][before-after-hooks] run at different points of the lifecycle:

```clojure
(cc/deffixture Addition
  {:cc/before-suite   #(println "AdditionFixture: I run before each Suite")
   :cc/before-spec    #(println "AdditionFixture: I run before each Spec")
   :cc/before-example (fn [exname] (println "AdditionFixture: I run before example" exname))
   :cc/after-example  (fn [exname] (println "AdditionFixture: I run after example" exname))
   :cc/after-spec     #(println "AdditionFixture: I run after each Spec")
   :cc/after-suite    #(println "AdditionFixture: I run after each Suite")})
```

##### Troubleshooting: Fail fast upon an exception or a failure

You can instruct clj-concordion to stop at once when a test fails or throws an
exception so that you can examine the runtime state. Use the following options:

* `:concordion/fail-fast true` - stop on the first failure or exception
* `:concordion/fail-fast :failures` - stop on the first failure
* `:concordion/fail-fast :exceptions`  - stop on the first exception; same as `:concordion/fail-fast-exceptions #{Throwable}`
* `:concordion/fail-fast-exceptions #{my.app.MyBizException, my.app.AnotherException}` - stop on the first exception of a matching type; can be combined with 
   `:concordion/fail-fast true` to also stop on test failures

(Notice that it is only meaningful to include both options if you use `fail-fast-exceptions` to limit to subclass(es) 
and `fail-fast true` so that it also stops for test failures.)

#### REPL development

To be able to run tests repeatedly from the REPL, you need to reset the previously cached results:

```clojure
(do
  (cc/reset-concordion!)
  (run-tests))
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When troubleshooting, [enable debug logging](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging/blob/master/README.md) for 
 namespaces `clj-concordion.*`.

### Common problems

#### Warning: The specification  with the fixture <spec> seems to have no asserts

This warning is logged when the result from Concordion has zero all of the success, failure, and exception counts.
It is OK to ignore if your `.md` file has indeed no asserts and you can disable it by setting the options
`{:cc/no-asserts? true}` on the `deffixture`. But if the spec has asserts and you expected to see some results then
something went wrong. Enable debug logging as described above, check carefully the output (also the terminal if you connect to a remote REPL),
try to debug to find out what is Concordion doing.

## Status

Alpha. Core features supported but there are certainly many rough corners and lurking bugs.

### Limitations

## Changelog

[See CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## TODO

* Re-run tests also when the .md files changes - add the resources/ to the watch path

## Implementation

NOTE: Concordion normally uses [OGNL](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-ognl/) to map function calls 
and property access in the specification to the fixture class. We replace it with
our own evaulator so that we don't need to generate classes from Clojure.

How is a specification test invoked:

> There's 2 places where the test runner is called:
  
> Directly when invoking a test - eg. the JUnit4 ConcordionRunner, the JUnit3 ConcordionTestCase. These call FixtureRunner which calls ConcordionBuilder. You're likely to want to create something similar to ConcordionTestCase and FixtureRunner, then reuse ConcordionBuilder - eg, see Mark Derricutt's basic TestNG runner. This was created way back for Concordion 1.3.1 - you'll need to implement the Fixture and FixtureDeclarations interfaces from Concordion 2.0.0 onwards.
>
> Indirectly, from a Concordion Suite, when the concordion:run command is encountered in a specification, spawning a new test within a test. If you want to support the concordion:run command, this is where the Runner / DefaultConcordionRunner comes in. By default ConcordionBuilder plugs in a SystemPropertiesRunnerFactory which lets you override the Runner with a system property. If this doesn't suit, we could open up withRunnerFactory as an extension method - rather than overriding RunStrategy which is designed to cater for different strategies for invoking the Runner.
